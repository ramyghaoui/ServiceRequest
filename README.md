ServiceRequest
==============

The Service Request is a PHP web application to which users can log in after they register a profile for their own.
Once they log in, this Service Request form should be filled with the type of support request, urgency of that request and a small description (printer malfunctioning, an application, network, hardwareâ€¦)
From the other side, the IT Department will open another form through which they can reply to all received request and convert them to pending or solved according to the issue status, database will be stored on MySQL Server so it can be used later on for reports about requests and solved issues for tracking purposes.
